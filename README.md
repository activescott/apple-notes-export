A script for programatically accessing your data in the Apple Notes application.

# Building

The package is written using Apple's "JavaScript for Automation", part of the [Open Scripting Architecture (OSA)](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AppleScript/Conceptual/AppleScriptX/Concepts/osa.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001571) that essentially allows you to use JavaScript to do the same things that AppleScript does. To run the script run the following from the root of the repo:

    yarn start
